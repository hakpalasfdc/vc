Open Enrollment Guidelines
</u></b></p>
<p> 
We have two options for OE.  Please let us know which one of these options you will use and provide dates if necessary.
</p>


<p><b>Option 1:
</b></p>
<ul><li> 
Client/TPA may continue to send us the prior plan year data until the 23rd, prior to OE effective date.
</li>
<li>
Send a separate OE file any time prior to the 23rd.
</li>
<li>
Once OE file is received, we will automatically run a test against our database and the OE test results will be sent to the client/TPA for review. 
</li>
<li>
We will hold the OE file until the 26th and the file will process between 26th and 31st depending on the OE month. 
</li></ul></p>
<p><b>
Option 2:</b> 
This is based on when the client/TPA plans to send their last production file for the current plan year. 
</p>
<ul><li>
Client/TPA must provide:
<ul><li><b>
Date of the last production file for the current plan year:________
</li>
<li>
Date of the OE file:_________
</b></li></ul>
<li><i><u>
Note:</u> 
If the client/TPA plans to send the OE file <u>after</u> the last production file, they must include a 3 day lag between the file transmission dates
</i></li>
<li>
Continue to send the current plan year data until the last production file date occurs.
</li>
<li>
If OE file is received prior to the last production file, we will run a test against our database and the OE test results will be sent to the client/TPA for review. 
</li>
<li>
We will hold the OE file until the last production file date occurs and it will be loaded the next day.
</li></ul></p>
<p><b>
The following applies to all OE files:
</b><ul>
<li>
The OE file <u>must</u> be a full file and contain all of the new plan year elections.
</li>
<li>
OE file should be sent utilizing the client's normal transmission method; however, the OE file name should be: <b>oe1234567</b> (1234567=the client's assigned File ID) 
</li>
<li>
The term by omission date will be the last day of the month prior to OE effective date.  (<i><u>For example:</u></i> For January OE effective date, term by omission will be 12/31/19; coverage levels will be effective 01/01/20)
</li>
<li>
Enrollment Verification Report (EVR) is sent after the Open/Annual file has loaded; this is used as confirmation that the file has loaded successfully; <u>no other confirmations are sent.
</u></li>
<li>
VSP does not issue ID cards or send enrollment communications out to the members.  Members can print out an ID card for a reference from VSP Resource Center online.
</li>
<li>
For any urgent manual updates, client/TPA can utilize the Client Portal at <a href="https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vsp.com&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C28e1a22570a14b50e96a08d6023c2e9c%7C3510753d6c4048ae9b9e2fc672d5e5dd%7C0%7C0%7C636698854833096939&amp;sdata=q0JuUNO8TFHczM8G1%2BgQuNFRiPT3Pz%2FQtgByDtoSufw%3D&amp;reserved=0">www.vsp.com</a>
</li>
<li>
Regular production files should resume after OE effective date and the file name must be changed back to <b>a1234567</b> or <b>g1234567</b> (1234567=the client's assigned file id) depending on the file layout. 
</li></ul></p>
